Database Initialization:
The code uses the mysql.connector library to connect to a MySQL database.
Two tables, employees and leave_requests, are created if they don't already exist. The employees table stores employee information, and the leave_requests table stores leave requests.

Manager Data Loading:
The read_manager_data function reads manager data from a text file (manager_data.txt) and returns a dictionary mapping manager names to their IDs.

Employee Class:
The Employee class represents an employee and has methods for creating employees, applying for leave, viewing leave balance, and retrieving all employees from the database.

Manager Class (Inherits from Employee):
The Manager class inherits from the Employee class and adds additional methods for manager-specific actions.
Manager validation is performed using the manager_data dictionary loaded from the file.

User Interaction (Menu):
A loop presents a menu with options for various actions in the Leave Management System.
Options include creating an employee, applying for leave, viewing leave balance, viewing/approving/rejecting/deleting leave requests (for managers), and exiting the system.

Menu Choices Implementation:
Choice 1 allows the user to create a new employee.
Choice 2 allows an employee to apply for leave, checking for date validity and available leave balance.
Choice 3 lets an employee view their leave balance.
Choice 4 allows managers to view pending leave requests.
Choices 5, 6, and 7 allow managers to approve, reject, or delete leave requests, respectively.
Choice 8 exits the system.

CSV Export:
After processing the menu choices, pending leave requests are exported to a CSV file (leave_requests.csv).

Error Handling:
The code includes error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid dates, insufficient leave balance, and manager validation.

Database Operations:
The code performs database operations using SQL queries for creating tables, inserting records, updating leave balances, and fetching data.

Datetime Handling:
The datetime module is used for handling date and time operations, such as parsing date strings.

File Handling:
The code reads manager data from a text file and appends new manager data to the same file.

Features Used:
MySQL database for storing employee and leave request data.
Object-oriented programming with classes for Employee and Manager.
CSV file export for pending leave requests.
User interaction through a console menu.
This code implements a basic Leave Management System with features for employee and manager interactions, demonstrating fundamental concepts like database operations, file handling, and object-oriented programming.
